## Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

## Introduction: Uncovering Sales Insights
In todayâ€™s competitive retail landscape, understanding sales performance across products, regions, and timeframes is crucial. This project dives into sales data for a retail store, aiming to uncover key insights and trends in product popularity, regional performance, and monthly sales patterns.
Our end goal? To provide stakeholders with actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. By analyzing this data, we can inform business strategies to optimize product offerings, improve regional marketing, and track seasonal sales trends.

## Objectives and Key Questions

We started with the following questions to guide our exploration and analysis:
- Product Insights: Which products are top-sellers, and which contribute the most revenue?
- Regional Performance: How does sales performance vary by region, and which areas are the strongest contributors?
- Time-Based Trends: What are the monthly sales trends, and are there specific patterns throughout the year?
- Customer Insights: Who are the top 5 customers by purchase amount?

By answering these questions, the project will support data-driven decision-making for the retail store, helping identify both successful strategies and areas for improvement.
